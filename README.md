# MakeCode Mob Events extension

This is an extension for Microsoft MakeCode for Minecraft Education that allows you to send commands to mobs. These commands are based on the events available from the [event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/commands/commands/event) slash command in Minecraft Bedrock Edition.

Each mob has their own set of events. For example, here are two events for cow mobs:

You can also control which mobs are affected by commands by adding rules to the selectors used to target them. Here's a program that explodes all creepers within 10 blocks of the player:

Note that these blocks are not compatible with the TargetSelector type from the Mobs category.

## Local Development

The vast majority of this extension is generated by a script. To regenerate the blocks and docs for `api.g.ts`:

```
node ./scripts/generate.js
```

To add new mob events, add them to `./scripts/spawn_events.json`.
